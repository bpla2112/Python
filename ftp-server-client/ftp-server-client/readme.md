# FTP Project - Bernardo Pla 
# CNT 4713 Spring 2017

This is the a project in which we were asked to implement a TCP style FTP server in python

This document will have a series of execution instructions and how they should be used. The execution of the program takes place within a terminal interface

### Running the FTP Server in a terminal
  1) First navigate to the following folder:
    ftp-bernardo-pla/ftpserver/
  2) type the command "python3 ftpserver-bernardopla-py3.py" 
  3) Press enter. The server should state a message "The server is ready to receive"
  **The server must be active at all times for the clinet to connect**
  
### Running the FTP client without test cases in a terminal
  1) Navigate to the folder: ftp-bernardo-pla
  2) Type the command "python3 ftpclient3v2.py"
  3) Press enter and have fun
  
### Running the FTP client with test cases 
  1) Navigate to the folder: ftp-bernardo-pla
  2) Type the command "python3 ftpclient3v2.py < sunnyday1.txt"
  3) Press enter and the ftp client will run the commands in the text file.
**NOTE: THE TEST CASES ARE AS FOLLOWS**
**SUNNYDAY1.TXT (sunnyday1.txt)**
**SUNNYDAY2.TXT (sunnyday2.txt)**
**RAINYDAY1.TXT (rainyday1.txt)**
**RAINYDAY2.TXT (rainyday2.txt)**

Have fun.
